        <strong>Rules:</strong>
        <br />
        Each player draws cards until the sum of the cards is close enough to 42 or has just exceeded 42. Each card must be different (no duplicates). Jack is worth 11 points, Queen 12, and King 13. Itâ€™s okay if Ace is always one. When the sum of card values exceeds 42, the player loses the game automatically.
        The player(s) with the sum of card values <strong>equal or lower</strong> and closer to 42 win(s) the sum of the points <strong>made by the other players</strong>.
